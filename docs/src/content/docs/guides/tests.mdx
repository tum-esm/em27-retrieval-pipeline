title: Automatic Test Suite
---

The pipeline comes with a suite of tests: They ensure the code is doing what it's supposed to and enable developers to change code confidently.

## Test Classes

There are four test classes ([using pytest marks](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/example/markers.html)):

1. `integration`: Test whether the pipeline is correctly set up on your system (testing config validity, connection to metadata, etc.)
2. `quick`: Test static type hints and small utility functions
3. `ci`: Test whether the pipeline is doing what it should
4. `complete`: Test whether the retrieval is doing what it should

The `ci` and `complete` tests download a sample dataset of three days (from two systems) and run all retrieval algorithms (Proffast 1 with GGG2014, Proffast 2.2 and 2.3 with GGG2014 and GGG2020). The `ci` does everything that `complete` does (spawning containers, moving files, etc.) but does not run the retrieval code itself. These two classes exist because the `complete` tests take 10-15 minutes on our 10-Core VM, whereas the `ci` tests can be run within 2-3 minutes in the GitHub CI environment on a 2-Core machine.

You can run the different test classes with: 

```bash
# one class
pytest -m 'quick'

# multiple classes
pytest -m 'quick or integration'
```

## Order of the Tests

The tests are ordered the following way - the fast tests should run first to get a quick feedback loop. Add the `--exitfirst` flag to stop the tests after the first failure.

1. Static types (`quick`)
2. Config template/documentation (`quick`) and local config (`integration`)
3. Utility functions (`quick`) and metadata/profiles connection (`integration`)
4. Run mock retrieval (`ci`)
5. Run full retrieval (`complete`)

## Retrieval Tests

When running the `ci` or `complete` tests, the test suite will download some sample data to `data/testing/container/em27-retrieval-pipeline-test-inputs-1.0.0.tar.gz` and unpack this into `data/testing/container/inputs`. After the tests have run successfully, the directory `data/testing/container/outputs` will be fully populated with the results of any retrieval algorithm using any atmospheric profiles.

**ðŸŒˆ You can use this as a demonstration of the input and output format of the pipeline.**
