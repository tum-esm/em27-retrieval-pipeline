# Using the Pipeline

## Setting up the Pipeline

**Get the code**

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/tum-esm/automated-retrieval-pipeline) or download the source code of a [specific release](https://github.com/tum-esm/em27-retrieval-pipeline/releases).
2. Create a virtual environment using `python3.11 -m venv .venv`
3. Always activate the virtual environment using `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the dependencies using `pip install ".[dev]"` or `pdm sync --group dev`

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">

We highly recommend using [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/) - a Python package manager - over pip. PDM uses a `pdm.lock` file - next to the `pyproject.toml` file - to pin the dependencies to specific versions. `pdm sync` installs the exact same dependencies on every system, hence errors are less likely not to be reproducible.

In our chair, we moved many projects from [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/) because Poetry uses its own `pyproject.toml` schema in contrast to PDM, which uses PEP standards ([PEP 508](https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/), [PEP 517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517), [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621)). Pip or any other tool can work with these PEP standards, but if Poetry has an issue, you cannot just use another tool - this happened to us a few times.

**Configure it on your system**

5. Install System Dependencies: e.g. `sudo apt install unzip gfortran`
6. Use the `config/config.template.json` to create a `config.json` file.
7. Set up the metadata locally or remotely (see [metadata guide](/guides/metadata))

**Run the tests to ensure everything is working**

8. Test the pipeline using `pytest -m "integration or quick or ci" --verbose --exitfirst tests/`
9. Test the actual retrieval using `pytest -m "complete" --verbose --exitfirst tests/`

**Celebrate if the tests pass**

10. Run `curl parrot.live`

**Use the CLI to run the pipeline**

The following sections describe how to trigger the different pipeline processes using the CLI. Whenever calling the CLI, it will validate the integrity of your local `config.json` file and output a message if your system is not correctly configured.

## Downloading Atmospheric Profiles

This pipeline automated the way of obtaining atmospheric profiles described in https://tccon-wiki.caltech.edu/Main/ObtainingGinputData. Add the email address to access the FTP server to `config.profiles.server.email` and configure the scope you want to download in `config.profiles.scope`.

Run the following command to download all the profiles:

```bash
python cli.py profiles run
```

This script will use the metadata and the configured local profiles directory to determine which profiles to request. Every time you call this script, it will request the profiles it has not already requested and check for the results of ongoing requests.

This process ensures that only `config.profiles.server.max_parallel_requests` are
running simultaneously. It only requests the same profiles again if they have not been generated within 24 hours. The script can download partial query results (e.g. if only days 1 to 5 of a 7-day request could be fulfilled).

You can use `config.profiles.GGG2020_standard_sites` to configure a list of standard sites you want to download. The script will never request profiles for these standard sites but only download the pre-generated data.

Run the following to request the current queue status of your account:

```bash
python cli.py profiles request-ginput-status
```

## Running Retrievals

Use the following commands to start the retrievals in a background process.

```bash
python cli.py retrieval start
```

You can limit the number of cores used by the retrieval process using `config.retrievals.general.max_process_count`.

Using the following commands, you can check whether the retrievals are still running and open a dashboard to monitor the progress.

```bash
python cli.py retrieval is-running
python cli.py retrieval watch
```

<img
  src="/images/cli-retrieval-watch.png"
  alt="Retrieval CLI Watch"
  width={2488}
  height={378}
  className="mb-4 w-full mx-auto block dark:hidden rounded-xl"
/>

Terminate the ongoing retrievals using the following command:

```bash
python cli.py retrieval stop
```

## Bundling All Retrieval Outputs

Bundle all the retrieval outputs using the following command:

```bash
python cli.py bundle run
```

## Generating GEOMS compliant HDF5 files

The [Generic Earth Observation Metadata Standard (GEOMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_Earth_Observation_Metadata_Standard) is a
standard for exchanging ground-based total-column concentration data. It uses the [HDF5 file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format)
and enforces a specific structure for the data (see [guidelines from EVDC](https://evdc.esa.int/documentation/geoms/)).

This pipeline can generate GEOMS compliant HDF5 files for the entire retrieval output. For that it requires the files `calibration_factors.json`
and `geoms_metadata.json` to be present in the configuration directory. You can use the [example files and the API reference](/api-reference/geoms-configuration)
to create your own files. You need to add a section `geoms` to the [general `config.json` file ](/api-reference/configuration) defining
the scope for which you want to generate GEOMS files.

As always, the pipeline will tell you if any of your configuration files are invalid. Create the GEOMS files using the following command:

```bash
python cli.py geoms run
```

The logs will report, which files have been generated:

```

You can verify the integrity of these HDF5 files using the [AVDC's Quality Assurance Tool](https://avdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.php?site=1473794367).

<Callout type="info" emoji="🐞">

The code to generate these GEOMS compliant HDF5 files has been adapted from the [PROFFASTpylot](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.06481). The authors of the
original code are Lena Feld, Benedikt Herkommer, Darko Dubravica affiliated with the Karlsruhe Institut of Technology (KIT).

Please make sure to not only cite this pipeline, but also the Proffast Pylot when using this feature.

## Generate a Data Report

You can generate a report about the data on your system using the following command:

```bash
python cli.py data-report
```

This script will produce one CSV file per sensor ID in the directory `data/reports/`:

The numbers in the columns "interferograms" and "ground_pressure" are the number of interferograms
and the number of ground_pressure lines for the respective day.
