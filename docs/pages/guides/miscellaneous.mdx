## How does the Pipeline determine which days to process?

The general philosophy of this pipeline is that "it populates output directories, with minimal internal queuing logic". This means it does not track which processes it has already run. If you point it to some input and output directories, it will produce any output that is not there and use the output directories as a source of truth, "which processes have already been run".

If it finds an output directory for a sensor-day combination (and selected retrieval algorithm and atmospheric profile model), it will not re-retrieve it. If you want to re-retrieve something because the inputs have changed (which should usually not happen), you have to delete the respective output directory or point the pipeline to a new output path.

## Hot to interpret the preprocessing error flags in Proffast 2.X?

The error flags are added up in the following way:

- `errflag` &nbsp;= `0`: no error
- `errflag` += `0.000.000.001` or `0.000.000.002`: solar elevation below 1 deg
- `errflag` += `0.000.000.010` or `0.000.000.020`: DC mean too low (below `DCmin`)
- `errflag` += `0.000.000.100` or `0.000.000.200`: DC variance too high (above `DCvar`)
- `errflag` += `0.000.001.000` or `0.000.002.000`: DC correction failed
- `errflag` += `0.000.010.000` or `0.000.020.000`: Not enough ifg points available on any side of the ifg for requested resolution
- `errflag` += `0.000.100.000` or `0.000.200.000`: Out-of-band artefacts are too strong
- `errflag` += `0.001.000.000` or `0.002.000.000`: Not enough points available for calculating phase spectrum
- `errflag` += `0.010.000.000` or `0.020.000.000`: Invalid spectral calibration
- `errflag` += `0.100.000.000` or `0.200.000.000`: Check consistency of fwd and bwd pair of spectra
- `errflag` += `1.000.000.000` or `2.000.000.000`: Phase error > 0.005

The numeric values are the same for `errflag_CO`, but some of the steps/checks are not performed on the CO band.

## Preprocess 5 in Proffast 2.3 fails with "Warning: inconsistent dualifg!"

We observed that Preprocess 5 (when using Proffast 2.3) cannot handle our old interferograms. The preprocess stops with the error message "Warning: inconsistent dualifg!". However, we can still process the interferograms with Preprocess 4 (using Proffast 2.2).

The log of the preprocess for these days looks like this:

## Can I use the PyPy interpreter to make the Pipeline faster?

Maybe, but this is not tested. Since the pipeline spends almost the entire time
on IO or running Fortran programs, using a faster Python interpreter will not
have a measurable impact on the runtime.
